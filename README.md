# Overview

This software is a simple text based 2048 game made with python

The purpose of this software was to allow me to learn how to use python in a basic way with variables, classes, different data structures like matrices, and 
then implement those things into working software.

# Development Environment

I used Visual studio code with some PyCharm community edition for debugging since I am more familiar with that in python.

I used python 3.9.7 for this project.

# Future Work

These are a few things I would like to add in the future.
* I would like to make this a draw-able game, add a GUI and make it look a bit nicer.
* Potentially a few different board sized which would likely make the game easier or harder
* Potentially add a multiplayer version, where 2 players race to get the highest score, 2048 wins. If one player loses of course then the other player wins anyway.
